# 🌟 Miscellaneous

A collection of robotics work, and hands-on technical projects that shaped my journey outside traditional coursework.

## 📷 Positions of Responsibility

### **Media Secretary — Electrical Engineering Students' Association (EESA)**  

- Helped plan and run department-wide events as part of a super energetic 12-member core team.  
- Grew the EESA Instagram page to **18k+ followers**, creating posters and fun visual content for all our events.
