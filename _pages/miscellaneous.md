# 🌟 Miscellaneous

A collection of robotics work, and hands-on technical projects that shaped my journey outside traditional coursework.

## 🤖 Robotics & Hands-On Engineering

### **XLR8 Robotics Challenge — IIT Bombay Robotics Club**  
Engineered a manually controlled robot capable of navigating diverse obstacles with high maneuverability, designed specifically for the **XLR8 obstacle-based racing competition**.  
The system integrated precise motor control, responsive steering, and robust mechanical design to achieve rapid traversal under competitive constraints.

### ✈️ **RC Plane Build Project — IIT Bombay Aeromodelling Club**  
Designed and assembled an **RC aircraft platform**, experimenting with aerodynamics, thrust–weight optimization, and stability control.  
Worked on frame fabrication, control surfaces, propulsion selection, and tuning for smooth flight dynamics.

## 📷 Positions of Responsibility

### **Media Secretary — Electrical Engineering Students' Association (EESA)**  

I was part of a super energetic 12-member core team that helped plan and execute major department-wide events. I also grew the EESA Instagram page to **2k+ followers** and EESA Facebook Page to **17k+ followers** by creating posters and engaging visual content for all our activities. As a key contributor to the 2-day EE fest *Impulse*, I worked on Alumni Networking, Workshops, Formals Night, Holi Night, and all media/publicity efforts. Through consistent design and content strategy, I significantly boosted EESA’s visibility and engagement across the institute.
