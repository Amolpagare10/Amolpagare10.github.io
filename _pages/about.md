👋 Hi! I’m **Amol**, a final-year Dual Degree student in Electrical Engineering at **IIT Bombay**, learning cool things across **Computer Architecture**, **VLSI Design**, and **Embedded Systems**.

🔧 I love working close to the metal — from designing **Out-of-Order Superscalar processors** and **RISC-V SoCs** to exploring **VLSI process flows**, **verification**, and **FPGA-based systems**.  
<!-- If it runs on silicon (or can be made to), I probably want to build it. -->

🌱 Recently, I’ve been working on:
- Booting **Linux on a custom RISC-V SoC**  
- Designing **OoO + superscalar CPU pipelines** in Verilog  
- Developing **EcoSync-8x**, an embedded sensing system for Structural Health Monitoring

🎯 Outside coursework, I enjoy playing badminton, exploring finance & algorithmic trading.

🚀 I’m excited about opportunities at the intersection of **hardware, systems, and intelligent computing** — especially roles involving **processor design, VLSI, CAD, and computer architecture research**.
