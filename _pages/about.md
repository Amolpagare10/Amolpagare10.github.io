  <h1 class="tech-title">Hi! I'm <strong>Amol</strong> 👋🏻</h1>

  <p class="tech-subtitle">
    I’m a Fourth-Year Dual Degree student in the Electrical Engineering Department at <strong>IIT Bombay</strong>, specializing in <strong>Electronic Systems</strong>. I work at the intersection of <strong>computer architecture, VLSI design, embedded systems, and intelligent algorithms</strong>.
  </p>

  <p class="tech-subtitle">
    Over the past few years, I’ve built systems that span the entire hardware stack — from transistor-level device modeling and physical design, to full RISC-V SoCs capable of booting Linux, to machine learning pipelines and computational biology workflows.
  </p>

  <h3 class="tech-heading">🧠 What I Work On</h3>
  <ul class="tech-subtitle">
    <li><span class="chip-tag">Computer Architecture</span> — RISC-V SoCs, OoO superscalar pipelines, caches, branch predictors</li>

  <h2 class="tech-heading">🔧 Systems & Architecture Experience</h2>
  <p class="tech-text">
    I’ve implemented full RISC-V systems—from microarchitectures to SoC boot flows. My key work includes building a 
    <strong>complete RISC-V SoC around the KianV core with SV32 virtual memory</strong>, implementing multicycle CPU control, integrating peripherals (UART, GPIO, SDRAM, SPI Flash, CLINT), and <strong>successfully booting Linux on FPGA</strong> using OpenSBI and U-Boot.
  </p>

  <p class="tech-text">
    I’ve also designed <strong>OoO superscalar processors</strong> with ROB, reservation stations, speculative execution, physical-register files, and full hazard-handling logic, along with <strong>in-order superscalar VHDL pipelines</strong> based on scoreboarding.
  </p>

<section class="tech-section">
  <h2 class="tech-heading">⚙️ VLSI, CAD & Fabrication</h2>
  <p class="tech-text">
    My VLSI work spans device physics, RTL design, and physical implementation. I’ve simulated fabrication steps (oxidation, diffusion, implantation) using <strong>Sentaurus, SRIM/TRIM, NanoHUB</strong>, studied advanced nodes (FinFET/GAAFET), and analyzed models like Deal–Grove and Massoud.
  </p>

  <p class="tech-text">
    On the CAD side, I’ve built systems using <strong>ROBDDs, ATPG (minisat), equivalence checking, deductive fault simulation</strong>, and designed circuits via Aa→VHDL workflows. I’ve also completed full RTL-to-GDS flows in <strong>OpenLane</strong> including synthesis, place-route, DRC/LVS, and Liberty/LEF generation.
  </p>

<section class="tech-section">
  <h2 class="tech-heading">🧬 AI, Computational Science & Machine Learning</h2>
  <p class="tech-text">
    I’ve applied ML and signal processing techniques to diverse problems—from <strong>wavelet-enhanced U-Net architectures for MRI segmentation</strong> to <strong>Monte Carlo simulations for option pricing</strong>, and <strong>multi-omics analysis</strong> integrating genomic variants and miRNA networks. 
  </p>

  <p class="tech-text">
    My experience also includes <strong>deep reinforcement learning</strong> (DDQN, Monte Carlo ES), chess engines, and quantum algorithms, including VQE, Grover’s, Simon’s, Shor’s, and teleportation protocols.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="tech-section">
  <h2 class="tech-heading">📡 Embedded Systems & Hardware Design</h2>
  <p class="tech-text">
    I’ve designed full embedded systems such as <strong>EcoSync 8X</strong>, an ultrasonic SHM device with dsPIC33A, ESP32 pipelines, custom PCBs, and enclosure design. My coursework includes extensive MCU development (8051, dsPIC), analog design (filters, log amplifiers), and biomedical instrumentation (ECG amplifier).
  </p>

<section class="tech-section">
  <h2 class="tech-heading">📚 Teaching, Mentoring & Open Source</h2>
  <p class="tech-text">
    I frequently help peers debug circuits, design pipelines, understand VLSI/architecture concepts, and structure labs. 
    I also reproduce algorithms from research papers—ranging from <strong>fault simulators</strong> to <strong>branch predictors</strong>—and I plan to publish clean, reusable documentation for students and developers.
