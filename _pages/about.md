👋 Hi! I’m **Tom**, a final-year Dual Degree student in Electrical Engineering at **IIT Bombay**, building cool things across **computer architecture**, **VLSI design**, and **embedded systems**.

🔧 I love working close to the metal — from designing **out-of-order processors** and **RISC-V SoCs** to exploring **VLSI process flows**, **verification**, and **FPGA-based systems**.  
If it runs on silicon (or can be made to), I probably want to build it.

🌱 Recently, I’ve been working on:
- Booting **Linux on a custom RISC-V SoC**  
- Designing **OoO + superscalar CPU pipelines** in VHDL  
- Implementing **hardware accelerators**, IC design flows, and verification stacks  
- Developing embedded sensing systems for real-world applications  

🎯 Outside coursework, I enjoy playing badminton, exploring finance & algorithmic trading, and designing hobby electronics.

🚀 I’m excited about opportunities at the intersection of **hardware, systems, and intelligent computing** — especially roles involving **processor design, VLSI, CAD, and computer architecture research**.
