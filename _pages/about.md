## 🌟 What I Love Working On

I enjoy working **close to the metal**, shaping how computation flows through silicon:

- Designing **Out-of-Order superscalar processors**  
- Building **RISC-V SoCs** with full Linux support  
- Exploring **semiconductor process flows**, physical design, and verification  
- Integrating **custom hardware + firmware** into FPGA-based systems  

If it involves pipelines, caches, timing diagrams, or silicon — I’m interested.

## 🎯 Beyond Academics

When I’m not debugging RTL or staring at timing reports, you'll find me:

- Playing **badminton** 🏸  
- Exploring **finance, quantitative strategies & trading**  
- Building small electronics projects

## 🚀 What I’m Looking For

I'm excited about opportunities at the intersection of:

- **Processor Design**  
- **VLSI / Physical Design**  
- **CAD for Digital Systems**  
- **Computer Architecture Research**  

If you're working in any of these areas — let's talk!
